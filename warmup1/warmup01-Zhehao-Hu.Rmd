#Cooking Recipe
##Bodega-Style Egg and Cheese Sandwich
###Igredients
* An English muffin, roll or two slices bread of your choice
* 2 teaspoons butter or oil
* 1 egg
* Salt and pepper
* 1 slice of cheese or a small pile of grated or crumbled cheese
* Spoonful of sliced scallions, chives, crumbled bacon, or whatever 
* else you want in your eggs

###special kitchen tool
* None

###Steps 
* Toast your bread. Heat a medium-sized skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium-high heat.

* Beat one egg with a 1/2-teaspoon water, a couple pinches of salt and a few grinds of black pepper until just blended.

* Melt butter in your pan or brush it with oil, to thinly coat it. Pour in the egg and roll it around so it coats the pan, as a thin crepe would. Immediately place your cheese and/or other fillings in the middle. After a minute, the egg will have set.

* Fold the part of the egg closest to you over the cheese, like the first part of a business letter fold.

#Euclidean Distance

##Definition
The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them($\overline{pq}$)

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (_p1_,_p2_,...,_pn_) and **q** = (_q1_,_q2_,...,_qn_) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	\ d(q,p) = d(p,q)&=\sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2+(q_2-p_2)^2+...+(q_n-p_n)^2}\\&= \sqrt{\sum{(q_i-p_i)^2}}
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
            
The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The [**Euclidean norm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm), or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:
$$\parallel p \parallel=\sqrt{p_1^2+p_2^2+...+p_n^2}=\sqrt{p\cdot p} $$

where the last expression involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
